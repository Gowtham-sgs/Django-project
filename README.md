# Django-project

This project has done as part of my internship, where I learned technologies like Django, Flask and MongoDB. This is a project titled "Development of REST API for Management of pharmacy using Django and MongoDB". 

This provides several APIs to customers for searching medicines based on different criterias and also to admin to search for orders and medicines and customer details.

This project has done using Django and MongoDB atlas, that is the data is stored in cloud. 

Only APIs are provided here, we can test them using Postman to see whether it is working properly.
