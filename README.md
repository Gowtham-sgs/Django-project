# Django-project

This project has done as part of my internship, where I learned technologies like Django, Flask and MongoDB. This is a project titled "Development of REST API for Management of pharmacy using Django and MongoDB". 

This provides several APIs to customers for searching medicines based on different criterias and also to admin to search for orders and medicines and customer details.

This project has been done using Django and MongoDB atlas. The operations are directly performed on the data stored in the cloud.
